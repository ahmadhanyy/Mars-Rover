# Rover On Mars

### Description

This project simulates the movement of a rover on mars. The rover can move in different directions and avoid obstacles in its path. It takes commands for moving forward, backward, and rotating left or right. The project also checks for obstacles and stops the rover when an obstacle is facing the rover. It also can take the target position and move in the shortest path to it avoiding the obstacles.


### Features
